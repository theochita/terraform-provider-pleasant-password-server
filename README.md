# Pleasant Password Server Provider (Terraform Plugin Framework)

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) >= 1.0
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.19

## Building The Provider

1. Clone the repository
```shell
git clone git@github.com:theochita/terraform-provider-pleasantpassword.git
```
2. Enter the repository directory
```shell
cd terraform-provider-pleasantpassword/
```
3. Build the provider using the Go `install` command:

```shell
go install
```

Terraform allows you to use local provider builds by setting a `dev_overrides` block in a configuration file called `.terraformrc`. This block overrides all other configured installation methods.

Terraform searches for the `.terraformrc` file in your home directory and applies any configuration settings you set.

```
provider_installation {

  dev_overrides {
      "registry.terraform.io/theochita/pleasantpassword" = "<PATH>"
  }

  # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
  # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
  # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
  direct {}
}
```

## Adding Dependencies

This provider uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
Please see the Go documentation for the most up to date information about using Go modules.

To add a new dependency `github.com/author/dependency` to your Terraform provider:

```shell
go get github.com/author/dependency
go mod tidy
```

Then commit the changes to `go.mod` and `go.sum`.

## Using the provider

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pleasantpassword = {
      source = "hashicorp.com/theochita/pleasantpassword"
    }
  }
}

provider "pleasantpassword" {
  server_url = "localhost:10001"
  username = var.pps_username
  password = var.pps_pwd
  allow_insecure = "true"
}

```

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (see [Requirements](#requirements) above).

To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To generate or update documentation, run `go generate`.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```shell
make testacc
```
